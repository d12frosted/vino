** About Vino

Vino is an advanced Emacs program tailored for managing wine cellars. It boasts a variety of built-in features, including wine rating and cellar tracking, alongside extension points for customisation. Importantly, Vino does not come preloaded with a database of wine-related information such as regions, appellations, grape varieties, producers, or specific wines. This design choice allows for a more personalised experience.

Explore [[https://barberry.io][Barberry Garden]] to see the potential of what can be developed using Vino and its companion, [[https://github.com/d12frosted/vulpea][Vulpea]].

** Installation and Configuration

For installation, our [[https://github.com/d12frosted/vino/wiki][wiki]] provides both concise and comprehensive guides suitable for various methods. It also offers detailed instructions on configuring Vino and organising your notes effectively.

Additionally, the [[https://github.com/d12frosted/vino/wiki][wiki]] includes guidance on how to enhance Vino's functionality, complete with practical examples.
