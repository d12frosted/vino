** About Vino

Vino is an advanced Emacs program tailored for managing wine cellars. It boasts a variety of built-in features, including wine rating and cellar tracking, alongside extension points for customisation. Importantly, Vino does not come preloaded with a database of wine-related information such as regions, appellations, grape varieties, producers, or specific wines. This design choice allows for a more personalised experience.

Explore [[https://barberry.io][Barberry Garden]] to see the potential of what can be developed using Vino and its companion, [[https://github.com/d12frosted/vulpea][Vulpea]].

** International Characters

Vino preserves international characters (accents, diacritics) in note titles. A wine or region named "Côtes du Rhône" keeps its proper spelling.

To search using ASCII characters (e.g., typing "Cotes" to find "Côtes"), you have two options:

1. *Completion framework support*: If you use [[https://github.com/oantolin/orderless][orderless]], prefix your search with =%= to enable char-fold matching. For example, =%cotes= matches "Côtes".

2. *Aliases*: Add an ASCII alias to your note. Vino expands aliases during selection, so both spellings become searchable:

   #+begin_example
   :PROPERTIES:
   :ID:       ...
   :ALIASES:  "Cotes du Rhone"
   :END:
   #+title: Côtes du Rhône
   #+end_example

** Installation and Configuration

For installation, our [[https://github.com/d12frosted/vino/wiki][wiki]] provides both concise and comprehensive guides suitable for various methods. It also offers detailed instructions on configuring Vino and organising your notes effectively.
