Il Frappato stems from a dream which I had when I was a girl to make a wine that
knows the land that I work, the air I breath, and my own thoughts. It is bitter,
bloody and elegant. That is Vittoria and the Iblei Mountains. It is the wine
that most resembles me, brave, original and rebellious. But not only. It has
peasant origins, for this it loves its roots and the past that it brings in;
but, at the same time, it is able to fight to improve itself. It knows
refinement without forgetting itself.
