*Features*

- [[https://github.com/d12frosted/vino/issues/55][vino#55]] Provide =vino-sources-fn= variable to allow completion of sources
  when acquiring a wine.

** v0.3.0
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:                     81df6136-0ec8-415d-9350-279b22629fef

Primarily migration to =org-roam= v2 that has many improvements and breaking
changes. See [[https://org-roam.discourse.group/t/the-org-roam-v2-great-migration/1505][The Org-roam v2 Great Migration]] for more information on automatic
migration. There will be a separate script to migrate all =vino= entries.

*Features*

- Faster database updates via =vino-db-update-file=, which is called
  automatically on buffer save. Also, since =org-roam= has changed the way
  database is built, =vino= doesn't advice/hook into =org-roam= database build
  process, but instead provides a separate pipeline similar to one in
  =org-roam=. See relevant section of README for more information.

*Breaking changes*

- Since =org-roam= doesn't provide tagging functionality anymore, there is no
  built-in way to use directories as tags, so each file must contain a
  =#+filetags= value. Newly created notes will get this automatically, old notes
  must be migrated.
- Template system has adapted to latest =vulpea-create= and =org-roam=. Most
  importantly, instead of being a full blown template accepted by
  =vulpea-create= it is now a property list simply allowing only values that
  make sense:
  - =:file-name= (mandatory) - file name relative to =org-roam-directory=;
  - =:head= (optional) - extra header of the created note;
  - =:body= (optional) - body of the created note;
  - =:context= (optional) - extra variables for =:file-name=, =:head=, =:body=
    templates.
  - =:properties= (optional) - extra properties to put into =PROPERTIES= block;
  - =:context= (optional) - extra variables for =:file-name=, =:head=, =:body=
    templates.

** v0.2
:PROPERTIES:
:ID: 16a41084-d445-47a2-adb5-eff9569dd8d4
:END:

Focus of this release is fulfilling [[https://github.com/d12frosted/vino/milestone/2][milestone#2]] goal - dedicated database for
=vino= needs.

*Feature*

- [[https://github.com/d12frosted/vino/issues/96][vino#96]] Allow to create grape synonyms during =vino-entry-read=.
- =vino-db= functionality with two tables - =cellar= and =ratings=.
- [[https://github.com/d12frosted/vino/issues/97][vino#97]] =vino-entry-note-get-dwim= also gets wine from the rating note.
- [[https://github.com/d12frosted/vino/pull/94][vino#94]] Provide two databases: =cellar= and =ratings= and all the machinery
  for its maintenance. See dedicated section for Database in README.

*Breaking changes*

- =vino-grape-template= does not include =vino-resources-template= anymore.

** v0.1.1
:PROPERTIES:
:ID: 26667ab6-6896-44bc-94b1-2526bde8cca4
:END:

Primarily a stabilization and bug-fix release.

*Fixes*

- [[https://github.com/d12frosted/vino/pull/84][vino#84]] Fix invalid vintage in rating title both in =vino-rating--create= and
  =vino-entry-update-title=.
- [[https://github.com/d12frosted/vino/pull/89][vino#89]] Add missing =autoload= comments.
- [[https://github.com/d12frosted/vino/pull/92][vino#92]] Do not allow to select vino entry that does not exist in
  =vino-entry-note-select=.
- Fix =vino-region-find-file= function.

*Features*

- [[https://github.com/d12frosted/vino/pull/85][vino#85]] Allow to create producer note when selecting non-existent producer.
  Affects =vino-producer-select=, =vino-producer-find-file= and
  =vino-entry-create=.
- [[https://github.com/d12frosted/vino/pull/86][vino#86]] Align behaviour of =vino-grape-select= with =vino-producer-select=, so
  the user is prompted to create a note when selecting a non-existent grape
  note.
- [[https://github.com/d12frosted/vino/pull/87][vino#87]] Allow to create region or appellation note when selecting non-existent
  region or appellation. Affects =vino-region-select=, =vino-region-find-file=
  and =vino-entry-create=.
- [[https://github.com/d12frosted/vino/pull/88][vino#88]] Switch to =vulpea-utils-with-note=.
- [[https://github.com/d12frosted/vino/pull/88][vino#88]] Use notes instead of ids in vino-netry
- [[https://github.com/d12frosted/vino/pull/91][vino#91]] Ask to acquire wine upon creation.
- Propose maximum 1 bottle of wine during consumption as default value.

*Breaking changes*

- Remove TIME-STAMP from templates. If user wants to use it, it's better to
  configure template, as timestamps require additional configurations and are
  not covered by =vino=.

** v0.1
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:                     81aaf405-b49b-4b96-811d-fb6989e6a26f
:END:

Initial release of =vino= application. The main goal of this release is to
achieve feature parity with [[https://github.com/d12frosted/environment/blob/3d387cb95353cfe79826d24abbfd1b6091669957/emacs/lisp/%2Borg-wine.el][+org-wine.el]]. See [[README.org][README]] for more information.

*Features*

- Functionality to create and find producers:
  - =vino-producer-create= - create a new =producer= note according to
    =vino-producer-template=.
  - =vino-producer-find-file= - select and visit =producer= note.
- Functionality to create and find grapes:
  - =vino-grape-create= - create a new =grape= note according to
    =vino-grape-template=.
  - =vino-grape-find-file= - select and visit =grape= note.
- Functionality to create and find regions and appellations:
  - =vino-region-create= - create a new =region= note according to
    =vino-region-template=.
  - =vino-appellation-create= - create a new =appellation= note according to
    =vino-appellation-template=.
  - =vino-region-find-file= - select and visit =region= or =appellation= note.
- Functionality to create and maintain cellar entries:
  - =vino-entry-create= - create a new =vino-entry= according to
    =vino-entry-template=. It interactively reads carbonation type, colour type,
    sweetness level, producer, name, vintage, appellation or region, grapes,
    alcohol level, sugar, resources and price. Producer, appellation, region and
    grapes are linked using =org-roam=.
  - =vino-entry-find-file= - select and visit =vino-entry=.
  - =vino-entry-update= - update visiting (or selected) =vino-entry=. It
    refreshes =rating= and =availability= (using =vino-availability-fn=). You
    rarely need to use this function, unless availability or rating is modified
    manually.
  - =vino-entry-update-title= - update visiting (or selected) =vino-entry=
    title. It also changes the title of all linked =ratings=. You only need this
    function if you modify a producer name, wine entry name or vintage manually
    and want to update everything. Might take a while, depending on amount of
    linked =ratings=.
  - =vino-entry-set-grapes= - set grapes of visiting (or selected) =vino-entry=
    by replacing existing.
  - =vino-entry-set-region= - set region (or appellation) of visiting (or
    selected) =vino-entry= by replacing existing.
  - =vino-entry-acquire= - acquire visiting (or selected) =vino-entry=. Reads a
    source, amount, price and date, and calls =vino-availability-add-fn=.
  - =vino-entry-consume= - consume visiting (or selected) =vino-entry=. Reads a
    action, amount and date, and calls =vino-availability-sub-fn=. For
    convenience also asks you to rate entry if the action is =consume=.
  - =vino-entry-rate= - rate a visiting (or selected) =vino-entry=. Reads a
    date, props defined by =vino-rating-props=, creates a new rating note
    according to =vino-rating-template= and creates a link between wine and
    rating.
