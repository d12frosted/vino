* Changelog

** Unreleased

*Features*

- Upgrade =vino-inv= module to Vulpea v2.

*Breaking changes*

- Remove unused =capture-properties= from templates.

** v0.5.0

This release migrates Vino to Vulpea v2, which removes the org-roam dependency and introduces breaking changes to the setup process. All documentation has been updated to reflect these changes, including comprehensive troubleshooting guides and improved examples.

*Breaking changes*

- *Vulpea v2 Migration*: Vino now requires Vulpea v2, which no longer depends on org-roam.
- *Setup Changes*: The =vulpea-setup= function no longer exists. Users must configure =vulpea-db-location=, =vulpea-db-sync-directories=, and enable =vulpea-db-autosync-mode= manually.
- *Database Sync*: Replace =org-roam-db-sync= with =vulpea-db-sync-full-scan=.
- *Template Syntax*: Template file-name patterns now use =${timestamp}= instead of =%<%Y%m%d%H%M%S>=.
- *Directory References*: Templates and configuration now reference =vulpea-default-notes-directory= instead of =org-roam-directory=.
- *Function Renames*: =org-roam-alias-add= replaced with =vulpea-buffer-alias-add=.
- *Internal Function*: =vino--slug= removed in favor of =vulpea-title-to-slug=.

*Features*

- New function: =vino-entry-set-price= to update wine entry prices.
- Add "Price Public" column to inventory UI.
- Inventory: Add hook for location change.

*Fixes*

- Use updated note when reordering meta.
- Define =vino-entry-meta-props-order= as =var= and not a =const=.
- Fix average score calculation using =amean= strategy.
- Use =vulpea-select-multiple-from= when selecting grapes to avoid repetition.
- Move =volume= property from bottle to wine entry.
- Mark and batch actions in UI.
- Fix emacsql invocation in inventory module.
- Add explicit =vulpea-db-update-file= calls after buffer modifications to ensure database consistency.
- Reload notes before running update hooks.
- Save buffer before running update hooks.

*Documentation*

- *Complete rewrite* of setup instructions for Vulpea v2.
- Add prominent migration warning for existing users.
- Add Quick Start Checklist.
- Add comprehensive Troubleshooting section to FAQ.
- Add visual note relationship diagram.
- Add progressive learning path for rating configuration (Beginner → Intermediate → Advanced → Expert).
- Document best practices for extension handlers with proper database synchronization.
- Add missing function documentation (=vino-entry-set-price=, inventory functions).
- Fix all code examples to work with Vulpea v2.
- Add intermediate rating configuration example.
- Improve clarity around template variables and their usage.

** v0.4.0

This release focuses on several key areas. First, it introduces powerful extension hooks that allow for building custom and complex flows on top of Vino. Second, it implements a basic solution for cellar tracking. Third, it simplifies the internals by adopting the latest features provided by the Vulpea library.

Unfortunately, this release contains many breaking changes. If you need assistance, please start a discussion.

Future releases will focus on fixing bugs and improving the Inventory solution.

*Breaking changes*

- Completely get rid of =vino-db=. Why? TL;DR =vulpea-db= is powerful enough to cover all the use cases I have ever faced. Over the last 2 years I have never used =vino-db=.
- Get rid of meta slot in =vino-rating=.
- Get rid of 'generic' inventory flow in favour of =vino-inv= plugin.
- Use 5-based scale for ratings by default and introduce means to change that.
- Add country to vino entry. This also affects all functions related to region/appellation selection and creation. Refer to documentation for more information.
- Remove resources from vino entry. The functionality can be replicated (if needed) using =vino-entry-create-handle-functions=.
- Get rid of =vino-entry= struct. Since =vulpea-note= became powerful enough there is little value in =vino-entry=.
- Merge =vino-entry-update= and =vino-entry-update-title=. These days Vulpea provides enough cached information to make the later fast enough to be merged with regular =vino-entry-update=.
- Sort metadata when updating note or setting origin.

*Features*

- Introduce rating precision, controlled by =vino-rating-precision=. See its documentation for more information.
- Introduce =vino-entry-create-handle-functions= as an extension point for vino entry.
- Introduce =vino-entry-update-handle-functions= as an extension point for vino entry.
- Introduce =vino-rating-create-handle-functions= as an extension point for vino rating.
- New function - =vino-entry-insert=.
- Inventory management. See relevant section in readme.
- Default templates now include proper tags.
- Use sane default for =vino-rating-props=.
- Ask for carbonation method for sparkling wines.
- Include extra information for traditional sparkling wines.
- Round rating when updating it.

** v0.3.1

*Features*

- [[https://github.com/d12frosted/vino/issues/55][vino#55]] Provide =vino-sources-fn= variable to allow completion of sources
  when acquiring a wine.
- [[https://github.com/d12frosted/vino/issues/64][vino#64]] Allow to provide extra meta when rating a wine.
- Allow to provide extra tags in all templates.

** v0.3.0

Primarily migration to =org-roam= v2 that has many improvements and breaking
changes. See [[https://org-roam.discourse.group/t/the-org-roam-v2-great-migration/1505][The Org-roam v2 Great Migration]] for more information on automatic
migration. There will be a separate script to migrate all =vino= entries.

*Features*

- Faster database updates via =vino-db-update-file=, which is called
  automatically on buffer save. Also, since =org-roam= has changed the way
  database is built, =vino= doesn't advice/hook into =org-roam= database build
  process, but instead provides a separate pipeline similar to one in
  =org-roam=. See relevant section of README for more information.

*Breaking changes*

- Since =org-roam= doesn't provide tagging functionality anymore, there is no
  built-in way to use directories as tags, so each file must contain a
  =#+filetags= value. Newly created notes will get this automatically, old notes
  must be migrated.
- Template system has adapted to latest =vulpea-create= and =org-roam=. Most
  importantly, instead of being a full blown template accepted by
  =vulpea-create= it is now a property list simply allowing only values that
  make sense:
  - =:file-name= (mandatory) - file name relative to =org-roam-directory=;
  - =:head= (optional) - extra header of the created note;
  - =:body= (optional) - body of the created note;
  - =:context= (optional) - extra variables for =:file-name=, =:head=, =:body=
    templates.
  - =:properties= (optional) - extra properties to put into =PROPERTIES= block;
  - =:context= (optional) - extra variables for =:file-name=, =:head=, =:body=
    templates.

** v0.2

Focus of this release is fulfilling [[https://github.com/d12frosted/vino/milestone/2][milestone#2]] goal - dedicated database for
=vino= needs.

*Feature*

- [[https://github.com/d12frosted/vino/issues/96][vino#96]] Allow to create grape synonyms during =vino-entry-read=.
- =vino-db= functionality with two tables - =cellar= and =ratings=.
- [[https://github.com/d12frosted/vino/issues/97][vino#97]] =vino-entry-note-get-dwim= also gets wine from the rating note.
- [[https://github.com/d12frosted/vino/pull/94][vino#94]] Provide two databases: =cellar= and =ratings= and all the machinery
  for its maintenance. See dedicated section for Database in README.

*Breaking changes*

- =vino-grape-template= does not include =vino-resources-template= anymore.

** v0.1.1

Primarily a stabilization and bug-fix release.

*Fixes*

- [[https://github.com/d12frosted/vino/pull/84][vino#84]] Fix invalid vintage in rating title both in =vino-rating--create= and
  =vino-entry-update-title=.
- [[https://github.com/d12frosted/vino/pull/89][vino#89]] Add missing =autoload= comments.
- [[https://github.com/d12frosted/vino/pull/92][vino#92]] Do not allow to select vino entry that does not exist in
  =vino-entry-note-select=.
- Fix =vino-region-find-file= function.

*Features*

- [[https://github.com/d12frosted/vino/pull/85][vino#85]] Allow to create producer note when selecting non-existent producer.
  Affects =vino-producer-select=, =vino-producer-find-file= and
  =vino-entry-create=.
- [[https://github.com/d12frosted/vino/pull/86][vino#86]] Align behaviour of =vino-grape-select= with =vino-producer-select=, so
  the user is prompted to create a note when selecting a non-existent grape
  note.
- [[https://github.com/d12frosted/vino/pull/87][vino#87]] Allow to create region or appellation note when selecting non-existent
  region or appellation. Affects =vino-region-select=, =vino-region-find-file=
  and =vino-entry-create=.
- [[https://github.com/d12frosted/vino/pull/88][vino#88]] Switch to =vulpea-utils-with-note=.
- [[https://github.com/d12frosted/vino/pull/88][vino#88]] Use notes instead of ids in vino-netry
- [[https://github.com/d12frosted/vino/pull/91][vino#91]] Ask to acquire wine upon creation.
- Propose maximum 1 bottle of wine during consumption as default value.

*Breaking changes*

- Remove TIME-STAMP from templates. If user wants to use it, it's better to
  configure template, as timestamps require additional configurations and are
  not covered by =vino=.

** v0.1

Initial release of =vino= application. The main goal of this release is to
achieve feature parity with [[https://github.com/d12frosted/environment/blob/3d387cb95353cfe79826d24abbfd1b6091669957/emacs/lisp/%2Borg-wine.el][+org-wine.el]]. See [[README.org][README]] for more information.

*Features*

- Functionality to create and find producers:
  - =vino-producer-create= - create a new =producer= note according to
    =vino-producer-template=.
  - =vino-producer-find-file= - select and visit =producer= note.
- Functionality to create and find grapes:
  - =vino-grape-create= - create a new =grape= note according to
    =vino-grape-template=.
  - =vino-grape-find-file= - select and visit =grape= note.
- Functionality to create and find regions and appellations:
  - =vino-region-create= - create a new =region= note according to
    =vino-region-template=.
  - =vino-appellation-create= - create a new =appellation= note according to
    =vino-appellation-template=.
  - =vino-region-find-file= - select and visit =region= or =appellation= note.
- Functionality to create and maintain cellar entries:
  - =vino-entry-create= - create a new =vino-entry= according to
    =vino-entry-template=. It interactively reads carbonation type, colour type,
    sweetness level, producer, name, vintage, appellation or region, grapes,
    alcohol level, sugar, resources and price. Producer, appellation, region and
    grapes are linked using =org-roam=.
  - =vino-entry-find-file= - select and visit =vino-entry=.
  - =vino-entry-update= - update visiting (or selected) =vino-entry=. It
    refreshes =rating= and =availability= (using =vino-availability-fn=). You
    rarely need to use this function, unless availability or rating is modified
    manually.
  - =vino-entry-update-title= - update visiting (or selected) =vino-entry=
    title. It also changes the title of all linked =ratings=. You only need this
    function if you modify a producer name, wine entry name or vintage manually
    and want to update everything. Might take a while, depending on amount of
    linked =ratings=.
  - =vino-entry-set-grapes= - set grapes of visiting (or selected) =vino-entry=
    by replacing existing.
  - =vino-entry-set-region= - set region (or appellation) of visiting (or
    selected) =vino-entry= by replacing existing.
  - =vino-entry-acquire= - acquire visiting (or selected) =vino-entry=. Reads a
    source, amount, price and date, and calls =vino-availability-add-fn=.
  - =vino-entry-consume= - consume visiting (or selected) =vino-entry=. Reads a
    action, amount and date, and calls =vino-availability-sub-fn=. For
    convenience also asks you to rate entry if the action is =consume=.
  - =vino-entry-rate= - rate a visiting (or selected) =vino-entry=. Reads a
    date, props defined by =vino-rating-props=, creates a new rating note
    according to =vino-rating-template= and creates a link between wine and
    rating.
